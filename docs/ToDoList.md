- [x] Look up Eldon's original project, write up specs for EE version
- [x] Set up project in Git
- [] Write up README

Set up the basic frameworks I was using before
- [x] Dropwizard
- [x] -Gradle build system- Maven build system instead, since that's what Dropwizard ships with, and all the docs use that.
- [] Postgres
- [] Liquibase
- [x] React
- [x] AntD
- [] Logging
- [] Unit testing - java (JUnit) and js (Jasmine?)
- [] Event tracking - something like KissMetrics, another system?

Once this is working as a local version, start looking into what it would take to convert it to an app.
