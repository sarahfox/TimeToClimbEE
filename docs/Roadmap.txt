Version 0.1 - Reimplement the existing functionality as a React-based site on Dropwizard.
	3 fields, single 'Calculate' button.  Fix the bug so table and calculations are always on the same plane.
	JSON file of airplane data
	Calculations working on the front end.
	Test set of calculations written, but no unit tests since the calculations will be moving to the back end fairly quickly.
	No DB
	
Wishlist:
	Add antD, CSS, Less, make it pretty.  Tabbed layout.
	Add some error checking to the input fields.
	Move calculations to backend.  Add unit tests.  Data still static, but use an api request to retrieve JSON.
	Add frontend cache of plane data received from backend - no reason to hit the backend multiple times if the data's static.
	Add DB storage of plane data. 
	Add UI and api for add/edit/delete of plane data.
	Add automatic lookup of plane data from FAA.
